# Phaser SAT Example

An example of using Separating Axis Theorem collision handling with Phaser.

**PhaserSat.js** is a heavily commented Phaser scene that puts all of this
together.

I put this together because I'm terrible at maths and wanted to learn how to
perform collision detection and response against sloped tiles. Something like
[this](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/diagrams/tutA_demo.html) from
a [fantastic tutorial](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/tutorialA.html)
from [Metanet](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/).

## Installation

Install the bower dependencies.

```bash
$ bower install
```

Open up `index.html` in your browser!

Be warned, the Phaser dependency is bleeding edge (dev branch). Change the
version and run `bower install` again if you want something stable.

## Controls

**WASD** to move around, **G** to toggle gravity.
